On  the “people mover” connecting the landside and airside terminals, I heard an ad read by a woman, in a calm, clear, and formal tone that would remind you of an airport: “British Airways is now offering direct flights to London” (or something similar). That gave me goosebumps. 
<i>London? What is it like? I am in Pittsburgh. </i>
At that moment, the distance between them seemed to have shrunk, as if the Atlantic Ocean had disappeared and the globe had become smaller.  

Being at the airport made me feel I was ever so close to distant places -- all I needed to do was to step through a gate and get on an airplane, as if the gate was some sort of magical portal. Denver, London, and Boston... I saw these cities on the displays as I passed them on the moving sidewalk. I’d be lying if I said the prospect of visiting these places didn’t intrigue me. 

While at the airport, I also thought of this vlog by John Green:

I was walking in Baker Hall yesterday and a cart of books quickly piqued my interest once I saw it from afar. Are these books being given away? I thought, excited. A unique feature of college that I love is that oftentimes there are books placed in front of offices that you can just freely take.

It turned out that Prof. Harsh, who taught history, was sorting her books as she was going to retire. She allowed me to take whatever book I wanted. Once I asked if she had any fictions, she led me into her office to show her collection of novels and started recommending books to me. 

Zola? Kundera? Sartre? Orwell? It was amazing. "I wish we were at my house!" she said. "I have <i>so</i> many novels at home."

I ended up leaving with a stack of books, held by both hands and secured by my chin so they wouldn't fall. I was overjoyed because I got free books, and Prof. Harsch also seemed happy as someone (may) read her books. I was very grateful.

Pittsburgh has the most beautiful clouds I've ever seen, anywhere.

Are we too obsessed with growth? Am I too obsessed with growth?
