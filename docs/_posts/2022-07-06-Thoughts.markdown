I was walking in Baker Hall yesterday and a cart of books quickly piqued my interest once I saw it from afar. Are these books being given away? I thought, excited. A unique feature of college that I love is that oftentimes there are books placed in front of offices that you can just freely take. I'd always browse the titles, which were often textbooks. 

It turned out that Prof. Harsh, who taught history, was sorting her books as she was going to retire. She allowed me to take whatever book I wanted. Once I asked if she had any fictions, she led me into her office to show her collection of novels and started recommending books to me. 

Zola? Kundera? Sartre? Orwell? It was amazing. "I wish we were at my house!" she said. "I have <i>so</i> many novels at home."

I ended up leaving with a stack of books, held by both hands and secured by my chin so they wouldn't fall. I was overjoyed because I got free books, and Prof. Harsch also seemed happy as someone (may) read her books. I was very grateful.

Are we too obsessed with growth? Am I too obsessed with growth?
